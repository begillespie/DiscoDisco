==========

Just a little toy I wrote in HTML. It fills the browser window with a grid of squares that flash and change color.

Installation and Use
--------------------

Just open index.html in your browser. It works in Chrome and Firefox. I don't have enough interest to make it work in IE. A control panel slides out from the left side of the screen to adjust the settings on the fly.
