==========

Just a little toy I wrote in HTML. It fills the browser window with a grid of squares that flash and change color.

Installation
------------

Just open index.html in your browser. It works in Chrome and Firefox. I don't have enough interest to make it work in IE. You can customize by changing the variables at the top of script.js.
